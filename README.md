#### Abstract:
<p align=" justify"> When two different images are presented separately to each eye, one experiences smooth transitions between them. Previous studies have shown that exposure to signals from other senses can enhance perceptual awareness of stimulation-congruent images. Surprisingly, despite our ability to infer perceptual consequences from bodily movements, evidence that action can have an analogous influence on visual experience is scarce and mainly limited to local (hand) movements. Here, we investigated whether one’s direction of locomotion affects perceptual awareness of optic flow patterns. Participants walked forwards and backwards on a treadmill while viewing highly-realistic visualisations of self-motion in a virtual environment. We hypothesised that visualisations congruent with walking direction would predominate in visual awareness over incongruent ones, and that this effect would increase with the precision of one’s active proprioception. These predictions were not confirmed: optic flow consistent with forward locomotion was prioritised in visual awareness independently of walking direction and proprioceptive abilities. Our results suggest that kinaesthetic-proprioceptive processing plays a limited role in shaping visual experience. This seems at odds with Bayesian accounts of perception but is in-line with Cancellation theories, which imply that crossmodal influences of self-generated signals are suppressed as a redundant source of information about the outside world. </p>

#### Steps to reproduce the analysis:
- download the entire repository as a zip-file 
- open the relevant code files in the downloaded folder (not directly from R studio, as the “here” function is used for setting up the directory)
- make sure that you have all the required packages installed
(they are loaded in the first chunk of each code file)
- for each code file, run the analysis chunk by chunk in sequential order.

The folder “_data” will contain both raw data files for each subject and the preprocessed data frames (the outputs from the preprocessing code files). The relevant data frames will be automatically read while running individual code files.

The folder “_figures” will contain the main and supplementary plots.

R Markdown reports (HTML files) present all the code files used along with their outputs.
