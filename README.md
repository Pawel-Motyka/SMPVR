Performing data analysis:

The folder "_scripts" contains the codes used for the main and supplementary analyses. If you want to run your own preprocessing (performed in the sections 1-3 of the main code: CCSomato_analysis_main.html), please contact the corresponding author for the raw data. The folder "_dataframes" contains the preprocessed data saved as the outputs from particular sections of the code. This enables starting the analysis of preprocessed data at different sections of the code by reading the relevant data frames using the prepared lines at the beginnings of sections. For example, one could read "CCSomato_ECG_data(output_from_section_3)" at the beginning of section 4 and run the following sections or start directly from the later sections by reading outputs from sections nr 4 or 7. The same procedure holds for supplementary results. 

The codes along with their outputs and plots can be also viewed by downloading and opening the revelant html files. The folder "_figures" contains the plots from the main and supplementary results.
